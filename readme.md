Fast React Pizza Project

## Overview

Fast React Pizza is a practice project that simulates an ordering platform, primarily built to sharpen skills in React's state management and routing techniques. It is an excellent showcase of a pizza ordering process using modern front-end technologies, providing a seamless user experience.

## Key Features :

1. **React-Router** - The project uses React Router for handling different routes within the application. This ensures seamless data fetching or uploading during route transitions.

2. **React Redux Toolkit** - To manage complex application states, the project utilizes the React Redux Toolkit, which provides a standardized, idiomatic way of handling state in React applications.

3. **Data Fetcher** - We've implemented a data fetcher for cross-route data fetching to ensure the availability of data when required, providing smooth transitions between different parts of the application.

4. **TailwindCSS** - To make the user interface more visually appealing, the project utilizes TailwindCSS, a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks to build bespoke designs without the repetitive and verbose nature of writing vanilla CSS.

5. **Project Structure** - The application is organized in terms of features, which means each feature contains all the implemented parts, such as components, hooks, reducers, and tests related to that feature. This structure is suitable for scalable applications and helps the developer navigate through the codebase easily.
